This python program will take some points and fit a curve to them.

To utilize this program, you must have python installed (version 2), matplotlib and numpy installed. Create a file
called data.txt and write your points to that file. For each x-value, the corresponding y-value should appear on the 
line right below it. For example, in the sample data given, the first point would be (2.8441, 1.7633). The algorithm
will then calculate a polynomial that fits all the points, and plot the points and polynomial so they can be viewed. In
the console, the corresponding weights for the polynomial will be listed. 

Improvements to this program will come soon. I hope that this programn is of some use to somebody!
